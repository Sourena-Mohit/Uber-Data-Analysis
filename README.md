# Uber Data Analysis

## Problem Statement

**Uber Technologies, Inc.** is a global transportation network company based in San Francisco, operating in over 72 countries and 10,500 cities. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Uber had approximately 118 million monthly active users worldwide, with an average of 19 million trips per day.

Ridesharing is a highly volatile market where demand can fluctuate significantly based on factors such as time, location, weather, and local events. Success in this industry relies on detecting patterns in these fluctuations and catering to demand accordingly.

As a newly hired Data Scientist at Uber's New York office, your task is to extract actionable insights from the data that can help the business better understand demand patterns and take appropriate actions to improve outcomes.

## Key Questions

1. What are the key variables that influence ride pickups?
2. Which factor has the most significant impact on ride pickups, and what could be the reasons behind it?
3. What recommendations can be made to Uber management to capitalize on fluctuating demand?

## Guidelines

- Perform **univariate analysis** to better understand the individual variables in the dataset.
- Perform **bivariate analysis** to explore relationships between different variables.
- Use **visualizations** to present data insights and identify patterns.
